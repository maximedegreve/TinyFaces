<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l">We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù) on the <a class="link link--blue"  href="https://tinyfac.es">tinyfac.es</a> website (‚ÄúWebsite‚Äù or ‚ÄúService‚Äù) and any of its related products and services (collectively, ‚ÄúServices‚Äù), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (‚ÄúUser‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù) and this Website operator (‚ÄúOperator‚Äù, ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms ‚ÄúUser‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyour‚Äù shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Collection of personal information</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content,  or fill any forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
<ul class="marginTopBottom-m">
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Account details (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)</li>
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc)</li>
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Basic personal information (such as name, country of residence, etc)</li>
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Biometric information (such as facial recognition, fingerprints, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners. Personal Information we collect from other sources may include demographic information, such as age and gender, device information, such as IP addresses, location, such as city and state, and online behavioral data, such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Privacy of children</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child‚Äôs Personal Information from our Services.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children‚Äôs Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Use and processing of collected information</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We act as a data controller and a data processor in terms of the GDPR when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l""> Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information and we comply with data controllers‚Äô obligations set forth in the GDPR.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller in terms of the GDPR.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul class="marginTopBottom-m">
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Create and manage user accounts</li>
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Deliver products or services</li>
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
</ul>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our Website and Services.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We rely on the following legal bases as defined in the GDPR upon which we collect and process your Personal Information:</p>
<ul class="marginTopBottom-m">
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">User‚Äôs consent</li>
</ul>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l""> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases above. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Managing information</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Website and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting us.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Disclosure of information</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l""> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our trusted subsidiaries and joint venture partners, affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, ‚ÄúService Providers‚Äù) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes. We will share and disclose your information only with the following categories of Service Providers:</p>
<ul class="marginTopBottom-m">
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Data analytics services</li>
<li class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate">Product engineering and design services</li>
</ul>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Retention of information</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Transfer of information</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. The transfer of your Personal Information to countries outside the European Union will be made only if you have explicitly consented to it or in the cases provided for by the GDPR and will be processed in your interest.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Data protection rights under the GDPR</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (‚ÄúEEA‚Äù), you have certain data protection rights and we aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Information. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">
(i) You have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your Personal Information. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your Personal Information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">(ii) You have the right to learn if your Personal Information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of your Personal Information undergoing processing.</p>

<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">(iv) You have the right to object to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">(v) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your Personal Information. These circumstances include: the accuracy of your Personal Information is contested by you and we must verify its accuracy; the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information and request the restriction of its use instead; we no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of processing, but you require it to establish, exercise or defend your legal claims; you have objected to processing pending the verification of whether our legitimate grounds override your legitimate grounds. Where processing has been restricted, such Personal Information will be marked accordingly and, with the exception of storage, will be processed only with your consent or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural, or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">(vi) You have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us. These circumstances include: the Personal Information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure such as where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, to exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">(vii) You have the right to receive your Personal Information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance from us, provided that such transmission does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">(viii) You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your Personal Information. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint directly with us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the EEA. This provision is applicable provided that your Personal Information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>

<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Data analytics</h2>
<p class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-3 c-slate marginBottom-l"">Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information.

For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The Website and Services do not track its visitors over time and across third-party websites.

When we do, we will post a notice on the Website.</p>
<h2 class="lineHeight-xl fontSize-l fontWeight-4 c-black marginTop-m">Changes and amendments</h2>
